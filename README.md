# ndx-genotype Extension for NWB

The aim of this extension is to enable scientists to systematically report in NWB the genotype of the transgenic animal used in their physiological experiments. Cell-type-specific recordings are often based on transgenic animals. Accordingly, mature infrastructure, such as public repositories and centralized databases, exist to support the scientific community in the use of these tools. This NDX integrates and leverages these resources for storing relevant metadata on the genotypes and genetic backgrounds of individual animals, linking neurophysiological data to the databases and literature that characterize the experimental animals. This extension is the result of a collaborative community effort as part of the NWB Genotype Working Group and implements the following [NDX Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12EVToclVEKXF8OP5hd6eaTYT6vj-ewhHYVM54u7h-tU/edit#heading=h.xk81rob2tb1l)
